# Sync Overview

**Performance Consideration**

- Every Stream has it's own [rate limirations](https://developers.klaviyo.com/en/reference/api-overview#rate-limits). But we handle them, and there should not be any problem during syncronization.

**Edge cases or known limitations**

- For this tables: `Lists Members`, if you have a lot of Members, there should be some delays because of the requests made and rate limitation, because we make request to get Lists and then we do one request for each member to get their info. If import of this table lasts more than 3 days and fails with timeout, please re-run the import or contact us.

- For most of the tables we eleminate duplicated records.

### Rate limits & Pagination
